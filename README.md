# Tail→Dash

A word game where you compete against the computer by transforming one word into another, one letter at a time.

## How to Play

1. The computer starts by picking a random 4-letter word
2. Players take turns creating new 4-letter words by changing exactly one letter from the previous word
3. Each word is scored using Scrabble-style letter points
4. The game continues until:
   - You get ahead by 5 or more points, or
